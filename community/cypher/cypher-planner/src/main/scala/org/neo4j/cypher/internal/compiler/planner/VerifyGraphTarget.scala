/**
 * Verifies correct graph selection done with USE clause.
 * Query router performs graph selection evaluation and sends a query
 * to a correct target, so this check is here mainly for queries submitted through
 * Core API which do not go through Query router.
 * USE clause is allowed for Core API queries, but since no routing is performed for such queries,
 * the USE clause is permitted to evaluate only to the session graph.
 * This verifier performs check for combination of explicit and ambient graph selection which is
 * useful even for queries that have gone through Query router as this check is not (and cannot be)
 * performed by semantic analysis.
